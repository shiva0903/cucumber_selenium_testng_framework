# cucumber_selenium_testng_framework
This repository contains selenium &amp; testng framework in conjunction with cucumber that testing projects can use for creating and running BDD tests with modified TestRunner.
This project is mainly based on the creation & running of dynamic XML from the TestCriterion 'Y' in Excel sheet which maintains data required for the AUT.
All this is happening in TestRunner class and only thing we are doing is selection of test cases to run and run the TestRunner class and create a report where it uses extent reports which is the best for logging and atatching screen prints in report itself
We can create a batch file from the Runner which is very simple.Inorder to view HTML content that is available in Status_report, place the path of HTML page link in this http://htmlpreview.github.io/
